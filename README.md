Age: As mentioned before, age is a significant risk factor for heart failure. The risk increases as people get older.
Sex: While both men and women can develop heart failure, some studies suggest a slight predominance in men.
    1.Male--M
    2.Female--F
Resting blood pressure (restingbp):  High blood pressure strains the heart, raising the risk of heart failure.

1. Normal : less than 120/80mmhg(mmhg--millimeters of mercury)
2.elevated : systolic 120-129 diastolic less than 80 mmHg 
3. stage 1 hyper tension  : systolic 130-139 diastolic 80 - 89 mmHg
4. stage 2 hyper tension  : systolic 140 or hhigher diastolic 90 or higher

MaxHR : An abnormally fast or slow heart rate can indicate underlying heart problems.


Cholesterol: High cholesterol contributes to coronary artery disease, a major risk factor.

Fasting blood sugar (fasting BS):High blood sugar can damage the heart and blood vessels, leading to heart failure.
Other Features:

Chest pain type (chestpaintype): This can indicate the type and severity of heart-related chest pain, a potential symptom.

Resting ECG (restingecg): An electrocardiogram measures the electrical activity of the heart and can reveal abnormalities.
1. normal 
2. ST--segment on the waveform 
3. left venticular hypertrophy
